# Computer Vision Playground

This repository contains my **computer vision projects and exercises**, carried out as part of my **self-learning and experimentation in programming and machine learning**.

## Contents

- **CV-from-scratch**  
  Manual re-implementation of algorithms studied in courses or on my own, to improve coding skills and gain a deep understanding. These implementations are not necessarily the most efficient, but they helped me fully grasp how the algorithms work.

- **CV-training**  
  Exercises and small projects to practice image and video processing with OpenCV and MediaPipe.

## Purpose

Documenting my experiments and learning in computer vision, in a clear and organized space for my projects.

## Main Technologies

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe
